----------

    The purpose of the Events page is to demonstrate the new events organised by the VIA Board Model.Game Group, to publish small articles about the latest gatherings and to help the reader by navigating them to the DSR Events Facebook page and to the Contact page for further information about the ways to get in touch with the VIA Board Model.Game Group.

    The events.html file is based on a triad structure with a Top, a Middle and a Bottom division.
