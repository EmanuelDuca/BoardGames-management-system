    <h1>ABSTRACT</h1>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <div class="textOverImage" style="background-image:url(./images/chess-img-png.jpg)"
      data-text="

                This type of board game is the oldest that is still played today. There are a few specific features that define this category of game: 
                No randomness (dice rolls, card draws, etc.) 
                There is no hidden information,
                Turn-based movement,
                The theme is not important. 
                Of course, there are some outliers. For instance, Stratego manages to incorporate hidden information without any random elements and is usually considered an abstract strategy game.
                Here are some of the best known games in this genre: Checkers, Go, Reversi, Chess  <br>
                There are more recent abstract games that have been huge hits like Azul, Blokus, Hive, and Shobu.

  <h1>COOP</h1>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <div class="textOverImage" style="background-image:url(./images/coop-game-img.jpg)" 
      data-text="

    <div class="col-md-8">
            Cooperative board games are a cornerstone of the hobby. They allow players to work together towards goals to beat the game. In that sense, players are actually playing against the board game. 
            One of the earliest and most successful cooperative board games is Pandemic which released in 2008 and sold countless units both physically and digitally (like on iOS). 
            Since then, several other coop board games have followed in step and there are tons of high-quality games that get players to work together. Here are some of the best:
            Spirit Island,
            Gloomhaven,
            Aeon’s End,
            Pandemic Legacy, 
            These games are extremely fun and accessible to anyone which makes this category one of the best for groups with people new to board games or younger children.

  <h1>DECK-BUILDING</h1>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <div class="textOverImage" style="background-image:url(./images/deck-building-img.png)" 
            data-text="
        Difficulty: Medium
        Max Players: 4
        Average lenght: 45min "></div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-8">
                The main mechanic in this genre of board games is building a deck, either before or during gameplay. This is similar to Trading Card Games (like Yu-Gi-Oh or Magic: The Gathering) in that decks are assembled by the players.
                However, these don’t require as much of a time and money investment and allow for more variety in strategy.
                This type of game was kicked off with the release of Dominion in 2008. Since then, there have been several excellent games that can be considered deck-building games:
                Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game,
                Thunderstone,
                Friday,
                Star Realms,
                Some of these games (like Mage Knight) have incorporated deck-building without making it the main mechanic in the game.

  <h1>PARTY</h1>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <div class="textOverImage" style="background-image:url(./images/party-game-img.png)"
              data-text="
          Difficulty: Easy
          Max Players: 5
          Average lenght: 30min"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-8">
                This type of game sells a ton of units due to its mass appeal. A party game gears itself towards groups of people that may not be particularly into tabletop games. 
                Here are some things that make a really good party game: 
                Easily Understood Rules,
                Quick Gameplay,
                Higher Maximum Player Count,
                Easy Setup, 
                There are a lot of games that fall into this category with some early entries into this genre being Charades and Pictionary. Those are not quite on the level of modern party games, here are some examples of newer games in this category:  <br>
                Codenames,
                Secret Hitler,
                Cards Against Humanity,
                Dixit, 
                The social aspect of these games set them apart from any other genre on the list. It makes this type of game super fun to play in any situation with pretty much anyone.
